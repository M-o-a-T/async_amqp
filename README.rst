trio-amqp
=========

The ``trio-amqp`` library is a pure-Python implementation of the `AMQP 0.9.1 protocol`_.

Built on top of Trio_, it provides an API based on coroutines, making it easy to write highly concurrent applications.

Bug reports, patches and suggestions welcome! Just open an issue_ or send a `pull request`_.

Status
------

The code works. Porting code that uses aioamqp (or even plain
python-amqp) should be reasonably straightforward.

All tests from aioamqp have been ported and succeed.


tests
-----

To run the tests, you'll need to install the Python test dependencies::

    pip install -r ci/requirements_dev.txt

Tests require an instance of RabbitMQ. You can start a new instance using docker::

     docker run -d --log-driver=syslog -e RABBITMQ_NODENAME=my-rabbit --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management

Then you can run the tests with ``make test`` (requires ``pytest``).


Future work
-----------

* Support message reception using async loops instead of callbacks.

* Add coverage reporting. Increase coverage (duh).

* Try restarting a failed AMQP connection instead of cancelling everything.
